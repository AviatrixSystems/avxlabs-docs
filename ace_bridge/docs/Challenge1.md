* Search for the Private IP address of the Proxy VM


**HINT**: Go to **CoPilot > Cloud Fabric > Topology** and find the Proxy VM and retrieve its IP from the **Properties** section.
 

By the end of this challenge you need to ensure that the flow goes beyond the Ingress spoke to the Transit and to the Proxy Spoke.
