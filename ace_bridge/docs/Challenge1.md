* Search for the Private IP address of the Proxy VM

```{hint}
Go to **CoPilot > Cloud Fabric > Topology** and find the Proxy VM and retrieve its IP from the **Properties** section.
```

* Try to ping the Proxy VM from the *Ingress Spoke GW*.

```{hint}
Go to **CoPilot > Diagnostics > Diagnostics Tools > Gateway Diagnostics**.

Select the **_Ingress Spoke GW_** and launch a **traceroute**/**ping** towards the private IP address of the Proxy VM.
```
</details>


```{attention}
By the end of this challenge you need to ensure that the flow goes beyond the Ingress Spoke to the Transit and to the Proxy Spoke.
```
