# Lab  SECURE HIGH-PERFORMANCE DATACENTER EDGE
This lab will demonstrate how securely connect on-prem  and Colo locations to CSP.

## 1. General Objectives

You are  asked to interconnect the on-prem DC in New York to your MCNA. An **Aviatrix Edge** device has already been provisioned and it got already registered to the existing **Aviatrix Controller**.

Aviatrix Secure High-Performance Datacenter Edge solution gives power back to the network administrators to deliver cloud connectivity without compromise.  The solution delivers encrypted, line-rate performance with single region, multi region, or multi cloud redundancy options and full visibility and troubleshooting capabilities end to end.

## 2. Initial set-up

Here is a view of the initial topology:
```{figure} images/hybrid-initial.png

Initial Topology
```
All applications in AWS and GCP have only **Private** IP’s

These are the CIDR blocks per each CSP:

- AWS = 10.0.1.0/24
- GCP = 172.16.1.0/24

The AWS instance and GCP instance are running several services on the following ports: 1433, 1521, 443, 5000, and 50100.

During the initial setup, MCNA was deployed. Both AWS and GCP environments are connected using the Aviatrix backbone.

## 3. Gatus Dashboards

All of the pre-deployed instances are running [Gatus](https://gatus.io/) and attempting to connect to each other on various ports. There are two gatus dashboard(s), deployed to `aws-gatus` https://aws.pod#.aviatrixlab.com/ and `gcp-gatus`, https://gcp.pod#.aviatrixlab.com/ visualize this connectivity continuously and in real-time. `Green` means a tcp connection was successful and `red` means it was unsuccessful.

```{note}
Above on url replace the **pod#**, with your assigned pod# e.g for **pod97** `aws-gatus` will become https://aws.pod97.aviatrixlab.com/
```
With pre-deployment and initial setup below is the gatus initial sample look
![Gatus cloud](images/aws-gatus-initial.png)

Note that the AWS/GCP and Edge connectivity sections are all `red`. These networks are not connected.
While AWS and GCP connectivity section are all `Green`. As These networks are already connected.

## 4. Edge Connectivity

Edge gateway is already deployed as shown in below topology.

## 5. Edge as DCF 
The rapid adoption of cloud services has transformed how organizations operate, offering scalability, flexibility, and reduced costs. However, it also introduces new security challenges. Traditional firewalls and security measures struggle to keep up with the dynamic nature of cloud environments. This is where Aviatrix Edge Gateway, functioning as a Distributed Cloud Firewall, makes a significant impact.

Edge Gateway as DCF provide
**Enhanced Security:** Comprehensive protection across multi-cloud and hybrid cloud environments.
**Simplified Management:** Centralized control with a unified security framework.
**Scalability:** Seamless scalability to meet the expanding needs of your cloud infrastructure.
**Operational Efficiency:** Reduced complexity leading to improved agility and reduced operational overhead.

### 5.1 Connectivity from on Prem Network Workstation to Cloud .
Previously, we successfully established connectivity between our On-Prem Network and both AWS and GCP Cloud environments. The topology is as follows:

![Edge Hybrid1](images/hybrid-final.png)

Let’s launch a connectivity test, from the Workstation “Edge” inside the on-prem network.
You can access the  `workstation Edge` https://edge.pod#.aviatrixlab.com , simply replace the **#** with your assigned pod number.
and login with username as `student`.

You will land on the Desktop of the Workstation Edge and from here launch the `LX Terminal`.

```{figure} ../../ace_pro/docs/images/lab8-newjoe4.png

LX Terminal
```

Now execute the **curl** command towards the private IP address of the **aws-instance** instance (**i.e. 10.0.1.10**) and **gcp-instance** instance (**i.e. 172.16.1.10**) on following ports
1433, 1521, 5000, 50100
You will get output similar like below.

![Edge Hybrid2](images/hybrid-work-1.png)

Also execute **curl** for https like below

![Edge Hybrid Work2](images/hybrid-workstation-2.png)

### 5.2 Implementiong DCF rules

There is a new security requirement stating that on-premises network workstations must not be able to communicate with the cloud over HTTPS or port 1521.

Go to **CoPilot > Cloud Fabric > Security > Distributed Cloud Firewall** and click on the `+Rule` button.

![Hybrid DCF1](images/hybrid-dcf1.png)

Fill in the Create Rule template using the following settings:

- **Name**: <span style='color:#479608'>On-Prem-to-Cloud-block-1521-443</span>
- **Source Groups**: <span style='color:#479608'>On-Prem-network</span>
- **Destination Groups**: <span style='color:#479608'>rfc1918</span>
- **Protocol**: <span style='color:#479608'>TCP</span>
- **Ports**: <span style='color:#479608'>1521, 443</span>
- **Action**: <span style='color:#479608'>Deny</span>

Make sure to **Logging** toggle on
Do not forget to click on **Save in Drafts**.

![Hybrid DCF2](images/hybrid-dcf2.png)

Do not forget to click on **Commit**.
![Hybrid DCF3](images/hybrid-dcf3.png)

Execute the previously run curl commands which we confirmed earlier that the applications hosted on the cloud are accessible from the On-Prem network.

Next, execute the same curl commands on ports 1521 and 443, where we have deployed the deny rule in Aviatrix DCF.

Observe that the connections from the On-Prem network to the CSP are now timing out.

![Hybrid DCF6](images/hybrid-dcf6.png)

Connections to CSP on other applications running on ports 1433, 5000, and 50100 remain accessible as before.

![Hybrid DCF7](images/hybrid-dcf7.png)

Now We can view the Distributed Cloud Firewall (DCF) Monitoring logs by following these steps:

1. Navigate to **CoPilot > Cloud Fabric > Security > Distributed Cloud Firewall**
2. Go to  **Monitor** tab.
3. Click on the `Columns` icon
4. Select `gateway` to include in the displayed columns.

![Hybrid DCF4](images/hybrid-dcf4.png)

In the search field, type 'on-prem' to filter all the logs that match the DCF rule name 'On-Prem-to-Cloud-block-1521-443'.

![Hybrid DCF5](images/hybrid-dcf5.png)

The DCF monitor logs indicate that on-premises to cloud traffic is being blocked in accordance with the DCF rule 'On-Prem-to-Cloud-block-1521-443'. This rule is implemented on the Edge Gateway, which is deployed within the on-premises network.
