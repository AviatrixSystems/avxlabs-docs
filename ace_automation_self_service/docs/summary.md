# Summary  

Congratulations! You have just onboarded, monitored, protected, and extended cloud networks using automation. Leveraging `GitHub Actions` and `Terraform HCL`, you have experienced the `"GitOps"` methodology in action. You've role-played development, security, and networking team personas in your organization to understand how each can collaborate in a CI/CD pipeline to implement changes to cloud networks in a secure and automated fashion. No meetings required!

Many of Aviatrix's largest customers leverage IaC to manage their networks. While the choice of tools (e.g. `Jenkins` instead of `Terraform HCL`, `GitLab` instead of `GitHub`) may vary across enterprises, the concepts of Infrastructure as Code remain the same.

As you review your achievement, we encourage you to explore further educational opportunities within the [Aviatrix Certified Engineer (ACE) Program](https://aviatrix.com/ace/). The ACE Program stands as the industry's premier multicloud networking certification, offering comprehensive training and specialized courses designed to deepen your understanding of building, operating, automating, scaling, and securing cloud networks across all major clouds.
