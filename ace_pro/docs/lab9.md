# Lab 9 - COSTIQ

## 1. Objective

This lab will demonstrate how `CostIQ` works.

## 2. CostIQ

- Define the following **Cost Centers** and **Shared Service**:

**<span style='color:orange'>COST CENTERS</span>**:

**AWS**:
- aws-us-east-1-spoke1
- aws-us-east-1-spoke2

**GCP**:
- gcp-us-central1-spoke1

**AZURE**:
- azure-west-us-spoke1
- azure-west-us-spoke2

**<span style='color:green'>SHARED SERVICE</span>**:

**NEW YORK DC**:
- workstation client "edge"

### 2.1 Enable CostIQ

Go to **Copilot > Billing & Cost > CostIQ** and click on the `"Enable CostIQ"` button.

Now click on `"+ Cost Center"` and create the **AWS** Cost Center aforementioned.

```

Repeat the action creating the remaining two Cost Centers: **GCP** and **Azure**, associating the corresponing Application VPCs/VNets.

```

You should immediately get insights on how they have been utilized.

## 3. New York DC is the Shared Services

Now let's discover the **CIDRs** of **New York DC**:

- Go to **CoPilot > Diagnostics > Cloud Routes > BGP Info**, then click on the three dots icon and select the `"Show BGP Learned Routes"`.

```{figure} images/lab9-costiq10.png

---
Show BGP Learned Routes
```

You will find out that all the local subnets advertised by the DC belong to the cidr **10.40.0.0/16**.

```

Let's move on the **Shared Services** tab and click on `"+ Shared Service"`.

```{figure} images/lab9-costiq12.png
---
align: center
---
"+ Shared Service"
```

Create the **Shared Service** based on the aforementioned requirements.

align: center
---
"+ Shared Service"
```

If you kept running the ping on the Workstation Edge's terminal, then you should see both the relative traffic and the absolute one from any Cost Centers towards the Shared Service.

After this lab, this is how the overall topology would look like:
