    * This provides you with the Network Engineer's toolkit (ICMP-based tools, TCP/UDP connectivity, packet captures) directly from an Aviatrix Gateway
    * Try to ping:
        * client-int.pod**X**.aviatrixlab.com
        * app.pod**X**.aviatrixlab.com
        * db.pod**X**.aviatrixlab.com

> **Note**
>
> Replace X in the **URLs** with the pod number assigned to you. You can view the pod number by accessing the [ACE Associate Lab Portal](https://associate-portal.ace.aviatrixlab.com)

 
### Expected Results
We have not built any connectivity yet, so none of the connectivity tests should work yet.  

## Lab 2.2 - Attaching Spokes
### Description

![CoPilot](images/tcp-flag.png)  
_Figure: TCP Flag Tags_

7. In the Records tab, you can view the raw flow logs. You should see the `App` trying to connect to the `DB` tier, but we only get a **SYN**.

### Expected Results
You should see something similar to this showing successful flows from Web to App, but unsuccessful from App to DB:  

![FlowIQ](images/syn.png)  
_Figure: FlowIQ_  

> **Note**
>
> No connectivity to the DB tier means that we only see SYNs. Use FlowIQ to get insights into all flows running over your secure cloud network.

## Lab 2.6 - CoPilot Topology
