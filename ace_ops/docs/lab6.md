## 2. CHANGE REQUEST

- Activate the **Route Approval** feature for monitoring unauthorized advertisements that could be received by the DC.

```{tip}
Navigate to **CoPilot > Cloud Fabric > Gateways > Transit Gateways >** select the **_ace-aws-eu-west-1-transit1_** GW **> Settings > Border Gateway Protocl (BGP)**, and enable the `Manual Learned CIDR Approval`
 toggle.

Then click on **Save**.

```

Afterward, inform the trainer that you have activated the feature using the <span style='color:orange'>**“Raise Hand”**</span> tool on Zoom, as shown below, and then type your POD number in the Zoom chat!

```

Navigate to **CoPilot > Cloud Fabric > Gateways > Transit Gateways >** select the *ace-aws-eu-west-1-transit1* GW and then the **Route Approval** tab.

```{note}
Please wait approximately **one or two minutes** for BGP to send the Update. Then, click the <span style='color:orange'>**refresh button**</span> to see the default route being advertised from the Data Center.

This route will remain in a <ins>**pending state**</ins> and will not be advertised within the CNSF until it receives final approval from the *Aviatrix Administrator*.

**Important**: Do not approve the route yourself. If you accidentally approve it, you can click "Remove" to revert it back to the Pending status.
```

Refresh
```

```{important}
You have successfully prevented someone from the Data Center from jeopardizing the entire network within the multicloud infrastructure.

<ins>Once again, please do not approve that default route</ins>!
```

## 3. SCENARIO#2

ACE’s On-Premises Partner needs to be connected to the Aviatrix CNSF in the GCP region. However, there is an IP overlap with BU1’s Analytics VPC.

You have been engaged to establish a <span style='color:#FF00FF'>**Site2Cloud**</span> connection between the GCP Spoke Gateway and the On-Premises Partner router, as well as to resolve the IP conflict using the **Mapped NAT** feature.

- **Local Gateway**: <span style='color:#479608'>ace-gcp-us-east1-spoke1</span>

- **Real Local Subnet CIDR(s)**: <span style='color:#479608'>172.16.211.0/24</span>

- **Virtual Local Subnet CIDR(s)**: <span style='color:#479608'>192.168.1.0/24</span>

- **Remote Gateway Type**: <span style='color:#479608'>Generic</span>

- **Real Remote Subnet CIDR(s)**: <span style='color:#479608'>172.16.211.0/24</span>

```{note}
Use the “**dig partner-csr-public.pod#.aviatrixlab.com +short**” command <ins>from your personal laptop terminal</ins> to resolve the symbolic public name of the OnPrem-Partner CSR router and retrieve the <ins>REMOTE GATEWAY PUBLIC IP address</ins>, as depicted in the example below.
```

<ins>Replace the **#** symbol with your POD number!</ins>

The example is referring to POD #35 (please issue the command based on your POD number!).

```

```{tip}
For **Windows OS** you can use the command `"nslookup"`:

**nslookup partner-csr-public.pod#.aviatrixlab.com**

```{figure} images/lab6-nslookup.png

S2C is finally UP
```

- Now it's time to **SSH** to the **OnPrem partner** router!

```{tip}
Access your personal POD Portal, locate the `"SSH widget for Cisco CSR"`, and use the provided credentials to connect to the CSR router as an On-Prem Partner.

```

After successfully logging into the On-Premises Partner router (also known as the _CSR router_), execute the following command to verify that the tunnel is active:

```bash
show ip int brief
```

```{figure} images/lab6-tunnelup.png
---
align: center
---
Tunnel1 up/up
```

Then from the **OnPrem Partner** router issue the following command:

```bash
ping 192.168.1.100 source gigabitethernet1
```

```{figure} images/lab6-pingok2.png
---
align: center
---
Ping is ok
```

- Execute the `Active Sessions` command.

```{tip}
Navigate to **CoPilot > Diagnostics > Diagnostics Tools > Gateway Diagnostics**, select the **_ace-gcp-us-east1-spoke1_** GW and then select the **Active Sessions** tool.

Click on **Run** and almost simultaneously issue once again the ping command from the CSR router.

Filter the results using the `"icmp"` keyword.
