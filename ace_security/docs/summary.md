# Summary  

Congratulations, you have completed Aviatrix FlightSchool!  Throughout the labs, we built connectivity in a single cloud, across multiple clouds, and did not have to touch a single Cloud Provider route table entry.  

We also added route domains and connection policies to segment our network, added Internet Egress security and have visibility into all traffic going over the AWS, Azure and GCP cloud networks.

If you have not done so already, please visit the following link to register for an upcoming [ACE Associate Flight School Bridge Training](https://aviatrix.com/ace-flightschool/).

We created the 90-minute Bridge Training as an exclusive offer for those who attended Flight School to get ACE Associate certified without taking the exam.

This training will cover the remaining topics required to get the ACE Associate certificate. The ACE Associate certification will allow you to take other advanced courses in the ACE Program, such as [ACE Automation](https://aviatrix.com/ace-automation/), [ACE Operations](https://aviatrix.com/ace-operations/), and [ACE Professional](https://aviatrix.com/ace-professional/).

The ACE Program is the industryâ€™s first and only multicloud networking certification. Its comprehensive trainings and specialized courses provide a deep understanding of how to build, operate, automate, scale, and secure cloud networks across AWS, Azure, GCP, and OCI. The ACE Program equips participants with best practices that span all major cloud providers, regardless of whether they use Aviatrix secure cloud networking.
