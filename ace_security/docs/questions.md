# Certification Questions

Use Aviatrix `CoPilot` to answer the following questions:

---

1. `GeoBlocking` is an Aviatrix feature that can block IP traffic to/from IP addresses associated with particular geographic regions. What, if any, regions are being blocked?

2. What encryption scheme is being used by the `site-to-cloud` connection with the Azure transit gateway?

3. A **major** intrusion has occurred. From which instance was this detected?

4. `Spoke-aws-dev` is isolated from 2 of of the 6 spoke or onprem `network domains`. Which 2 spokes can it not communicate with due to the configured network segmentation?

5. Traffic from the `gcp-dev-vm` instance (in `spoke-gcp-dev`, network domain: `gcp-dev`) cannot connect to the `azure-prod-vm` instance (in `spoke-azure-all`, network domain: `azure-all`) on port 443 despite the fact that the two network domains are connected. Why is this?

6. How many https egress domains are being explicitly allowed?

7. The `azure-dev-vm` cannot communicate with the `azure-prod-vm` despite being deployed to the same `vnet`. Why is this?

8. There are 3 VMs that have been automatically added to the `SmartGroup` named `dev`. Why were they added to this group?

9. Name the `Aviatrix` gateway where `ThreatIQ` has detected malicious inbound attacks.

10. Name 3 domains where egress connectivity is being attempted, but denied.

11. Gateway Learned CIDR Approval is enabled on `transit-aws`. What is the pending learned CIDR?
