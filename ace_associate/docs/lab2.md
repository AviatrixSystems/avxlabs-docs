```

* This provides you with the Network Engineer's toolkit (ICMP-based tools, TCP/UDP connectivity, packet captures) directly from an Aviatrix Gateway
    * Select the `ping` option and launch ping towards the following nodes:
        * client-int.pod**X**.aviatrixlab.com
        * app.pod**X**.aviatrixlab.com
        * db.pod**X**.aviatrixlab.com

```{tip}
Keep the default value for the interface: `"Use Route Table"`.

Click on **Run** for executing the ping command.
```

```{note}
Replace X in the **URLs** with the pod number assigned to you.

### Expected Results
We have not built any connectivity yet, <ins>so none of the connectivity tests should work yet</ins>.  

## Lab 2.2 - Attaching Spokes
### Description
Attach Spoke VPCs/VNets to their Transits
### Validate
* Open the CoPilot 
* Navigate to **_Cloud Fabric > Gateways > Spoke Gateways_** and edit the Spoke Gateway **_azure-web-node_**

```{figure} images/azure-web-node.png
---
align: center
---
Edit the Azure Spoke Gateway
```

Select the Transit Gateway **_azure-transit_** from the drop-down window from the `"Attach To Transit Gateway"` field, and then click on **Save**.

```{figure} images/azure-transit.png
---
align: center
---
Attach the Spoke to the corresponding Transit GW
```

* Perform these addiitonal actions: 
  * Select _azure-app-node_ and connect it to the _azure-transit_
  * Select _aws-db-node_ and connect it to the _aws-transit-gw_

```{note}
To speed things up, feel free to open multiple browser tabs, and run the **Spoke Attachment** step in each tab
```

```{hint}
You can verify if spokes were correctly attached by viewing notifications. On the top right corner, click on the **_task icon_**, you should see success notifications for the actions you performed above. See an example below:  

```{figure} images/task-icon.png

## Lab 2.3 - Test the Web App
### Description
Test the Web App
### Validate
* Open the Remote Access Server
* Open **Firefox** from the Desktop on the Remote Access Server
* Navigate to [http://web.pod**X**.aviatrixlab.com]()

```{note}
Replace **X** in the **URL** with the pod number assigned to you. 

You can view the pod number by accessing the <a href="https://associate-portal.ace.aviatrixlab.com" target="_blank">ACE Associate Lab Portal</a>
```

### Expected Results
You should see something similar to this:

## Lab 2.4 - CoPilot Diagnostics
### Description
Using CoPilot Diagnostics Tools
### Validate
* Go to **CoPilot > Diagnostics > Diagnostics Tools**, and select the **azure-web-node** Gateway.
* Try to ping/traceroute:
    * client-int.pod**X**.aviatrixlab.com
    * app.pod**X**.aviatrixlab.com
    * db.pod**X**.aviatrixlab.com

You should be able to ping successfully both the **APP** Virtual Machine and the **Client** within the DC, thanks to the attachments among the Gateways and the Site2Cloud connection with the remote CSR router.

```{important}
**_There is a huge benefit to owning the data path in the cloud!  You have complete visibility and have the tools needed to troubleshoot and operate your network!_** 
```

### Expected Results
You should see something similar to this:

```{figure} images/lab2-pingok.png
---
align: center
---
CoPilot Ping
```   

```{note}
Since there is no connectivity to AWS, the DB node should not be pingable, due to the absence of the `Peering` between the two Transit Gateways!
```

## Lab 2.5 - FlowIQ
### Description
Using CoPilot **FlowIQ** to debug flows
### Validate
1. Use the left hand search bar within CoPilot to locate **_FlowIQ_** 

```{figure} images/flowiq-screen.png
---
align: center
---

```

1. Add also the **_TCP Flag Tags_** parameter among the existing columns.

```{figure} images/tcp-flag.png
---
align: center
---
TCP Flag Tags
```

Do not forget to click on **Apply**.

- In the Records tab, you can view the raw flow logs. You should see the `App` (i.e. 10.x.`32`.x) trying to connect to the `DB` (i.e. 10.x.`64`.x) tier, but we only get a **SYN**.

### Expected Results
You should see something similar to this showing successful flows from Web to App, but unsuccessful from App to DB:  

```{figure} images/syn.png
---
align: center
---
Only SYN packet
```

```{note}
No connectivity to the DB tier means that we only see SYN packets, from the APP to the DB. 

Use **FlowIQ** to get insights into all flows running over your secure cloud network.
```

## Lab 2.6 - CoPilot Topology
### Description
Using CoPilot Topology to visualize your secure cloud network.
### Validate

Topology Overview
```

```{note}
- Azure Spokes are connected to the Azure Transit
- AWS Spoke is connected to the AWS Transit. 

We do not have connectivity between AWS and Azure. Not yet at least!
```

```{important}
**_Visualizing a network can be so helpful!_**
```

## Lab 2.7 - Multicloud Peering

### Description

By this point we should have verified that connectivity in Azure is good, but we are missing the connectivity between Azure and AWS, in order to complete the 3-tier architecture connectivity, among, the APP, the WEB and the DB.

 Aviatrix offers a simple but powerful method for interconnecting clouds.

### Validate

* Navigate to **_Cloud Fabric -> Gateways -> Transit Gateways_** and edit the Transit Gateway **_aws-transit-gw_**, clicking on the pencil icon:

```{figure} images/aws-transit-edit.png
---
align: center
---
Edit Transit Gateway
```

* Select the Transit Gateway **_azure-transit_** from the drop-down window from the `"Peer To Transit Gateways"` field, and then click on **Save**.

```{figure} images/peering.png
---
align: center
---
Establish peering between Transit Gateways
```

## Expected Results
* Verify that the peering has been established 
* Navigate **_Cloud Fabric -> Gateways -> Transit Gateways_** and click on the transit gateway **_aws-transit-gw_**

```{figure} images/aws-transit-gw.png
---
align: center
---
Select the Transit GW
```

* Then select the tab **_Connections -> Transit-Transit peering_**, as depicted below.

```{figure} images/peering-ok.png
