```

* This provides you with the Network Engineer's toolkit (ICMP-based tools, TCP/UDP connectivity, packet captures) directly from an Aviatrix Gateway
    * Select the `ping` option and launch ping towards the following nodes:
        * client-int.pod**X**.aviatrixlab.com
        * app.pod**X**.aviatrixlab.com
        * db.pod**X**.aviatrixlab.com

```{tip}
Keep the default value for the interface: `"Use Route Table"`.

Click on **Run** for executing the ping command.
```

```{note}
Replace X in the **URLs** with the pod number assigned to you. 

You can view the pod number by accessing the **ACE Associate Lab Portal**

### Expected Results
We have not built any connectivity yet, <ins>so none of the connectivity tests should work yet</ins>.  

## Lab 2.2 - Attaching Spokes
### Description
Attach Spoke VPCs/VNets to their Transits
### Validate
* Open the CoPilot 
* Navigate to **_Cloud Fabric > Gateways > Spoke Gateways_** and edit the Spoke Gateway **_azure-web-node_**

```{figure} images/azure-web-node.png
---
align: center
---
Edit the Azure Spoke Gateway
```

Select the Transit Gateway **_azure-transit_** from the drop-down window from the `"Attach To Transit Gateway"` field, and then click on **Save**.

```{figure} images/azure-transit.png
---
align: center
---
Attach the Spoke to the corresponding Transit GW
```

* Perform these addiitonal actions: 
  * Select _azure-app-node_ and connect it to the _azure-transit_
  * Select _aws-db-node_ and connect it to the _aws-transit-gw_

```{note}
To speed things up, feel free to open multiple browser tabs, and run the **Spoke Attachment** step in each tab
```

```{hint}
You can verify if spokes were correctly attached by viewing notifications. On the top right corner, click on the **_task icon_**, you should see success notifications for the actions you performed above. See an example below:  

```{figure} images/task-icon.png

## Lab 2.4 - CoPilot Diagnostics
### Description
Using CoPilot Diagnostics Tools
### Validate
* Go to **CoPilot > Diagnostics > Diagnostics Tools**, and select the **azure-web-node** Gateway.
* Try to ping/traceroute:
    * client-int.pod**X**.aviatrixlab.com
    * app.pod**X**.aviatrixlab.com
    * db.pod**X**.aviatrixlab.com

You should be able to ping successfully both the **APP** Virtual Machine and the **Client** within the DC, thanks to the attachments among the Gateways and the Site2Cloud connection with the remote CSR router.

```{important}
**_There is a huge benefit to owning the data path in the cloud!  You have complete visibility and have the tools needed to troubleshoot and operate your network!_** 
```

### Expected Results
You should see something similar to this:

```{figure} images/lab2-pingok.png
---
align: center
---
CoPilot Ping
```   

```{note}
Since there is no connectivity to AWS, the DB node should not be pingable, due to the absence of the `Peering` between the two Transit Gateways!
```

## Lab 2.5 - FlowIQ
### Description
Using CoPilot **FlowIQ** to debug flows
### Validate
1. Use the left hand search bar within CoPilot to locate **_FlowIQ_** 

```{figure} images/flowiq-screen.png

```{figure} images/tcp-flag.png
---
align: center
---
TCP Flag Tags
```

Do not forget to click on **Apply**.

- In the Records tab, you can view the raw flow logs. You should see the `App` (i.e. 10.x.`32`.x) trying to connect to the `DB` (i.e. 10.x.`64`.x) tier, but we only get a **SYN**.

### Expected Results
You should see something similar to this showing successful flows from Web to App, but unsuccessful from App to DB:  

```{figure} images/syn.png
---
align: center
---
Only SYN packet
```

```{note}
No connectivity to the DB tier means that we only see SYN packets, from the APP to the DB. 

Use **FlowIQ** to get insights into all flows running over your secure cloud network.
```

## Lab 2.6 - CoPilot Topology
### Description
Using CoPilot Topology to visualize your secure cloud network.
### Validate

-	Search for **_Topology_**

Topology Overview
```

```{note}
- Azure Spokes are connected to the Azure Transit
- AWS Spoke is connected to the AWS Transit. 

We do not have connectivity between AWS and Azure. Not yet at least!
```

```{important}
**_Visualizing a network can be so helpful!_**
```

## Lab 2.7 - Multicloud Peering

### Description

By this point we should have verified that connectivity in Azure is good, but we are missing the connectivity between Azure and AWS, in order to complete the 3-tier architecture connectivity, among, the APP, the WEB and the DB.

 Aviatrix offers a simple but powerful method for interconnecting clouds.

### Validate

* Navigate to **Cloud Fabric > Gateways > Transit Gateways** and edit the Transit Gateway **_aws-transit-gw_**, clicking on the pencil icon:

```{figure} images/aws-transit-edit.png
---
align: center
---
Edit Transit Gateway
```

* Select the Transit Gateway **_azure-transit_** from the drop-down window from the `"Peer To Transit Gateways"` field, and then click on **Save**.

```{figure} images/peering.png
---
align: center
---
Establish peering between Transit Gateways
```

## Expected Results
* Verify that the peering has been established

```{tip}
Navigate **Cloud Fabric > Gateways > Transit Gateways** and click on the transit gateway **_aws-transit-gw_**
```


```{figure} images/aws-transit-gw.png
---
align: center
---
Select the Transit GW
```

* Then select the tab **Connections > Transit-Transit peering**, as depicted below.

```{figure} images/peering-ok.png
---
align: center
---
Transit Peering established
```

```{warning}
You may need to refresh or wait **_60-120 seconds_** for the connection status to become green (UP).
- Check CoPilot Topology to verify the state of the links
```

**Congratulations!!! You have now built a Multicloud Network! Secure cloud networking has never been so easy...**

```

### Lab 2.8 - Test the Web App
### Description
Check whether the Web App is up and running.

### Validate
* Using the RDP session, open Firefox and navigate to: 

[http://web.pod**X**.aviatrixlab.com]()
* If the site is already open, click the Refresh button

```{note}
Replace **X** in the **URL** with the pod number assigned to you. 

You can view the pod number by accessing the **ACE Associate Lab Portal**
```

### Expected Results
You should see something similar to this, meaning the Database is still not accessible!

```{figure} images/webapp-db-down.png
---
align: center
---
DB is still down...
```

## Lab 2.9 - Debug the Egress section
### Description
The database is actually just a **_proxy_** to Amazon DynamoDB. 

Perhaps the proxy cannot reach DynamoDB.

### Validate
* After testing that the connection between Web and App works and seeing that the DB connection fails, verify the `Logs` on the **Egress** section.

```{tip}
Go to **CoPilot > Security > Egress > Monitor** and select the **_aws-db-node_** VPC.
```

```{figure} images/lab2-egressmonitor.png
---
align: center
---
Egress Monitor section
```

You will see immediatelly all the Logs related to the Distributed Cloud Firewall Rules. 

- Search for the `"Denied"` action.

### Expected Results
* It appears that the Egress filter is not allowing access to:  **_dynamodb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com_** on port **443**.
* You should see somethiing like the following:

```{figure} images/lab2-denied.png
---
align: center
---
Egress Monitor section
```

## Lab 2.10 - Inspect the Distributed Cloud Firewall 
### Description
Check the Distributed Cloud Firewall Rules
### Validate
Go to **CoPilot > Security > Distributed Cloud Firewall > Rules**

```{figure} images/lab2-dcf.png
---
align: center
---
DCF rules
```

You will notice **4** rules:

1- <span style='color:#00FFFF'>**allow-internet-http**</span>
  - This rule allows the DB instance to generate **HTTP** (port 80) towards Internet against specific domains (there is a WebGroup named *"allowed-internet-http"* attached to the rule itself).

2- <span style='color:#00FFFF'>**allow-internet-https**</span>
  - This rule allows the DB instance to generate **HTTPS** (port 443) towards Internet against specific domains (there is a WebGroup named *"allowed-internet-https"* attached to the rule itself).

3- <span style='color:#00FFFF'>**allow-rfc1918**</span>
  - This rule allows all kind of **_East-West_** traffic within the multicloud infrastructure.

4- <span style='color:#00FFFF'>**default-deny-all**</span>
  - This is the **_Explicit Deny Rule_** that permits to achieve the ZTNA (Zero Trust Network Access) approach!

The denied domain is **_dynamodb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com_**. This domain should be allowed within the WebGroup `"allowed-internet-https"`! 

## Lab 2.11 - Check and Modify the WebGroup
### Description
Modify the Distributed Cloud Firewall WebGroup
### Validate
Go to **CoPilot > Security > Distributed Cloud Firewall > WebGroups** and modify the WebGroup `"allowed-internet-https"`

```{figure} images/lab2-webgroup.png
---
align: center
---
WebGroups
```

You will notice that the WebGroup only contains two domains:

1- *.us.east-1.amazonaws.com

2- *.snapcraft.io

```{figure} images/lab2-webgroupno.png
---
align: center
---
WebGroups
```

- Add the required Domain Name `dynamodb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com` within the *Domains/URLs* field and then click on **Save**.

```{figure} images/lab2-webgroupok.png

align: center
---
Editing the WebGroup 
``` 

### Expected Results
Go to **CoPilot > Security > Distributed Cloud Firewall > Monitor** and filter out based on the `"L7 Logs"`.

```{figure} images/lab2-finalok.png
---
align: center
---
L7 Log
``` 

You will notice that now the DB instance can successfully reach the DynamoDB!

## Lab 2.12 - Sign-in to the Web App
### Description
Now that we have built the connectivity, our Web App should be up and running.

### Validate
* Log in to the **Remote Access Server**
* Open Firefox on the Desktop and navigate to: [http://web.pod**X**.aviatrixlab.com]()

```{note}
Replace **X** in the **URL** with the pod number assigned to you.

You can view the pod number by accessing the **ACE Associate Lab Portal**
```

You will finally see all the three tiers (i.e. Web, App and DB) in `"STATUS: UP"`

* Click **Sign In**, enter something in the **Comments** and click **Submit** to sign-in to the **WALL OF FAME**

### Expected Results

```{figure} images/lab2-signin.png
---

```

```{figure} images/lab2-submit.png
---
align: center
---
Insert your Comment!
```

```{note}
You should see that all 3 App Tiers are now up and can talk to each other. You should also be able to register yourself in the form, and also be able to view the Wall of Fame!

**Nice work!** 
```
