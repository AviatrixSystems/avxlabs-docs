# Challenge 4 - Web VM to DB VM

## Scenario

After resolving the challenge#3, the Database VM administrator mentioned that the Database is receiving requests from an IP range in the **11.64.0.0/24** space.

* Check where this range is coming from
* Why isn't the response being received on the Databse Spoke gateway?

**HINT**: Use packet capture on a specific egress interface of the Database Spoke GW.
