# Summary  

Congratulations, you have completed the ACE Automation instructor led training!  Throughout the labs, we built connectivity across multiple clouds without touching a single CSP route table entry!

We also added network domains and connection policies to segment and connect networks, inserted a 3rd party NGFW, applied custom routing cidrs, and applied distributed cloud firewall rules down to the tag, cidr, and VPC/Vnet.
