# Lab 10 - COSTIQ

This lab will demonstrate how `CostIQ` works.

## 1. CostIQ Overview

The CostIQ feature provides detailed traffic distribution analysis for your cost centers, including traffic flowing to shared-service resource hosts by Cloud Account, by Cost Center, by VPC/VNet, and by Gateway.

## 2. Implement CostIQ

- Define the following **Cost Centers** and **Shared Service**:

**<span style='color:orange'>COST CENTERS</span>**:

**AWS**:
- aws-us-east-1-spoke1
- aws-us-east-1-spoke2

**GCP**:
- gcp-us-central1-spoke1

**AZURE**:
- azure-west-us-spoke1
- azure-west-us-spoke2

**<span style='color:green'>SHARED SERVICE</span>**:

**NEW YORK DC**:
- workstation client "edge"

### 2.1 Enable CostIQ

Navigate to **Copilot > Settings > Configuration > General**. Locate the **Features** section and enable `CostIQ`. 

Do not forget to click on **Save**.

```{warning}
Refresh the web page, before proceeding with the next task!
```

- Navigate to **Copilot > Monitor > CostIQ** and click on `"+ Cost Center"` and create the **AWS** Cost Center.

```

- Repeat the action creating the remaining two Cost Centers: **GCP** and **Azure**, associating the corresponing Application VPCs/VNets.

## 3. New York DC is the Shared Services

Now let's discover the **CIDRs** of **New York DC**:

- Navigate to **CoPilot > Diagnostics > Cloud Routes > BGP Info**, then click on the three dots icon and select the `"Show BGP Learned Routes"`.

```{figure} images/lab9-costiq10.png
---
align: center
---
Show BGP Learned Routes
```

You will discover that all local subnets advertised by the data center fall within the CIDR range of **10.40.1.0/24**.

```{figure} images/lab9-cidr.png
---
align: center
---
CIDR
```

Navigate to **CoPilot > Monitor > CostIQ > Shared Services** and click on the `"+ Shared Service"` button.

```{figure} images/lab9-costiq12.png
---
align: center
---
"+ Shared Service"
```

Create the **Shared Service** based on the aforementioned requirements.

```{figure} images/lab9-costiq13.png
---
align: center
---
"+ Shared Service"
```

## 4. DCF Configuration

- Create a rule that permits **ICMP** traffic from the **Workstation Edge** to the **_aws-us-east-2-spoke1-test1_**.

### 4.1 Create a new SmartGroup for the WorkstationEdge

Navigate to **CoPilot > Groups** and click on the `"+ SmartGroup"` button.

```{figure} images/lab10-newsg.png

align: center
---
SmartGroup
```

Ensure these parameters are entered in the pop-up window `"Create SmartGroup"`:

- **Name**: <span style='color:#479608'>WorkstationEdge</span>
- **Virtual Machines**:
  - **Matches all conditions (AND)/Name**: <span style='color:#479608'>onprem-pod##-host-vm</span>

```{figure} images/lab10-newsg854.png

```

```{warning}
Do not select the value ending with **"vm-1"**.

```

```{figure} images/lab10-newsg01.png

```

Do not forget to click on **Save**.

### 4.2 Create a new SmartGroup for aws-us-east-2-spoke1-test1

Click again on the `"+ SmartGroup"` button.

```{figure} images/lab10-newsg090.png
---
height: 400px
align: center
---
SmartGroup
```

Ensure these parameters are entered in the pop-up window `"Create SmartGroup"`:

- **Name**: <span style='color:#479608'>aws-us-east-2-spoke1-test1</span>
- **Matches all conditions (AND)/Name**: <span style='color:#479608'>aws-us-east-2-spoke1-test1</span>

```{figure} images/lab10-newsg0133.png
---
height: 400px
align: center
---
aws-us-east-2-spoke1-test1 SG
```

Do not forget to click on **Save**.

### 4.3 Create a new DCF rule

Navigate to **CoPilot > Security > Distributed Cloud Firewall > Rules (default tab)** and create a new rule clicking on the `"+ Rule"` button.

```{figure} images/lab10-newnew00.png
---
align: center
---
New Rule
```

Enter the following parameters:

- **Name**: <span style='color:#479608'>inter-icmp-edge-us-east2-test1</span>
- **Source Smartgroups**: <span style='color:#479608'>WorkstationEdge</span>
- **Destination Smartgroups**: <span style='color:#479608'>aws-us-east-2-spoke1-test1</span>
- **Protocol**: <span style='color:#479608'>ICMP</span>
- **Logging**: <span style='color:#479608'>On</span>
- **Action**: <span style='color:#479608'>**Permit**</span>

Do not forget to click on **Save In Drafts**.

## 5. Verification

### 5.1 Connectivity Testing Using Gatus App

Navigate to your POD Portal, locate the `Gatus widget`, and select **_onprem-pod<span style='color:#33ECFF'>##</span></summary>-edge_**.

```{figure} images/lab10-podportal110.png
---
height: 400px
align: center
---
Gatus
```

The traffic generated from the Workstation Edge will gradually turn green!

```{figure} images/lab10-podportal111.png

---
WorkstationEdge
```

### 5.2 Connectivity Testing Using the SSH Client <span style='color:#33ECFF'>(BONUS)</span></summary>

If you run the ping from the Workstation Edge terminal to the **aws-us-east-2-spoke1-test1** instance, you should see both relative and absolute traffic from the two Cost Centers in AWS. The GCP and Azure environments, on the other hand, will show 0% traffic since no data is being directed toward the Shared Service in the New York data center.

```

### 5.3 Cost Center and Shared Service

Navigate to **CoPilot > Monitor > CostIQ > Shared Services** and click on **NEW YORK DC** to expand the visibility of the percentage of traffic between the **Cost Center** in AWS and the **Shared Services** in NY DC.

This traffic is permitted thanks to the DCF rule previously created.
