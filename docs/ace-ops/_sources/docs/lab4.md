## 2. TROUBLESHOOT REQUEST

    	

- Verify that the connectivity between **BU1 Frontend** and **BU2 Mobile App** is actually broken.

  - SSH to BU1 Frontend and launch ping/ssh to BU2 Mobile App.

- Check whether the concerned Spokes have the relevant routes or not.

```{tip}
Go to **CoPilot > Cloud Fabric > Gateways > Spoke Gateways >** select the **ace-aws-eu-west-1-spoke1** gateway and filter out based on the remote route.
```

From the outcome above, it is evident that Spoke1 in AWS has the destination route in his RTB.

 - Use Diagnostics tool by clicking on the Spoke1 Gateway in AWS and try to ping/traceroute the instance behind the other spoke.

```{tip}
Go to **CoPilot > Cloud Fabric > Topology** and select the concerned Spoke Gateway and click on **Tools** and then on **Gateway Diagnostics**.
```

- Check if the concerned Spoke VPCs are inspected by FireNet.

```{tip}
Go to **Controller > FIREWALL NETWORK > Policy**
```

- Have a look at the dashboard on the main page of the Controller.

- Verify the Vendor Integration on the FireNet section on the Controller!

```{tip}
Go to **Controller > FIREWALL NETWORK > Vendor Integration**, select the **FW**, click on **EDIT** and then click on **SHOW**.
```

You will notice that the **10.0.0.0/8** is not present inside the routing table of the FW.

- Fix the problem, clicking on the **SYNC** button, in order to inject again the 10.0.0.0/8 into the RTB.

- Relaunch the ping from **BU1 Frontend** towards **BU2 Mobile App**.
