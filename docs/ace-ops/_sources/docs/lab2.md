# Lab 2 - Connection Policy

## 1. SCENARIO

Now ACE Inc. has decided that BU1 and BU2 need to be able to communicate with each other. You are engaged for applying a **Connection Policy** in order to merge the two routing domains.
After the change has been applied, verify that both the network domains have been merged together, successfully.

## 2. CHANGE REQUEST

* Apply the Connection Policy

```{tip}
Go to **CoPilot > Networking > Network Segmentation > Network Domains** and then edit either network domains.
```

The Connection Policy works bidirectionally!

- Check Network Segmentation on the CoPilot by searching segmentation and look at the **Logical View**.

```{tip}
Go to **CoPilot > Networking > Network Segmentation > Overview > Logical View**. This time you can notice the relationships established between the two Network Domains.
```

- Verify the connectivity **between** BU1 and BU2 domains.

  - SSH to any instances inside any BUs and carry out ping/ssh commands between the two BUs.
  - Ping and SSH between the two BUs should finally work, thanks to the Connection Policy (aka **VRF leaking**).

- Check the different routing tables (VRFs) maintained by any of the Transit Gateways.

```{tip}
Go to **CoPilot > Cloud Fabric > Gateways > Transit Gateways >** select the relevant gateway **> Gateway Routes** and filter out based on any Network Domains.
```
